In the assignment process, we will strive to make the teams diverse and at the same time balanced.

- Wed., July 21: Team assignment and prerecorded introduction session available
- Thu., July 22: Live kick-off session at 14:00h (GMT+2)
- Fri, July 23: Live check-in session at 14:00h (GMT+2)
- Sat, July 24: Live check-in session at 14:00h (GMT+2)
- Sun, July 25: Submission Deadline at 23:59h (GMT+2) 

## Formalities
Please note the folowing formalities and general informations. If anything is unclear or you reqruie additional information, please reach out to us organizers ([Karsten](mailto:donnay@ipz.uzh.ch) and [Aleksandra](mailto:urman@ifi.uzh.ch)):

### Communication

- The main communication venue is our Slack space "ic2s2datathon2021"; all participants have been invited directly (if you did not receive an invitation, please let us know!)
- All live sessions take place via Zoom; the link is provided in the _#general_ channel on Slack

### Assignment process

- We conducted a brief survey of all registered participants between July 13 and 19 to learn more about your individual backgrounds.
- The teams of 4-5 participants were then matched to ensure that each team reflects different levels of experience and skills while matching stated interestes and ensuring compatibility in terms of time zone.
- If participants did not provide any information, we randomly assigned them to a team.

### Submissions

- Deadline: **Sun, July 25 at 23:59h (GMT+2)**
- We ask you to prepare a **video (max. 15 min)** explaining your question and findings
- You may also provide additional documentation (e.g., an interactive website, PDF documents etc.)
- **Please do not submit any data or code!**
- All submissions will be **public** and made via this GitHub repository; we will provide submissions folders for each group labeled by your assigned group number
- Winning projects will be announced by **Thu, July 29** and featured in the lunch session at IC2S2

## Task

### Overview
The COVID pandemic has upended daily lives and everyday behaviors, including through drastic counter-measures such as lockdowns or mobility restrictions. There is at the same time unprecedented data coverage that allows nuanced analysis of the relationship between pandemic dynamics, changes in population mobility and the progress in vaccination campaigns and, of course, how the public perceives such measures. In this datathon, teams of 3-4 participants will be tasked to explore these relationships using a variety of highly spatially and temporally resolved datasets on each of these dynamics. The datasets, among others, will include mobility data during the pandemic and social media data. The goal is to use a data-driven lense to investigate these fundamental co-dependencies and reveal important variations within and between countries. Using the data provided, teams are free to focus on a particular aspect or question of their choice while leveraging any methodological approach. 


### Topic & possible questions
Teams are free to address any question that can be addressed with the datasets provided and that are related to the impact of Covid-19 on population mobility. We have outlined a few possible concrete example questions but those are only meant as an orientation or inspiration and should in no way limit what exactly you want to work on!

- **Association between mobility patterns and case numbers** e.g., is a reduction in the visits to grocery stores associated with decreased covid cases within ~10-14 days?
- **Association between public opinion and mobility changes** e.g., is there a mobility divide? Do we see persistent differences in terms of mobility during covid between countries? What are potential explanations for this?
- **Vaccination and mobility** e.g., how fast does vaccination bring people back to “business as usual”? Does increase in vaccination lead to increase in mobility even when all measures stay in place?


### Datasets
(_description still currently incomplete and too short; to be edited_)

We suggest working with several datasets.
Some of them deal with mobility during COVID-19 times around the globe.
These are Google's Covid mobility dataset https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/
And Apple's mobility dataset https://covid19.apple.com/mobility
To augment this data and check the situation regarding COVID-19 in specific countries, you can use data on COVID-19 cases, ICU occupancy, hospitalizations, etc. There are many data sources for that. One we suggest using is https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide or on vaccinations outside the EU/EEA area from here https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

In addition you may use any other complementary datasets on any dimension of your choice as long as these data are in the public domain and freely accessible.
