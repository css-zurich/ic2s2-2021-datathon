# ic2s2-datathon

Hi and welcome to the IC2S2 2021 virtual datathon!
Here you will find a short description and some background information!

## Brief description:
The COVID pandemic has upended daily lives and everyday behaviors, including through drastic counter-measures such as lockdowns or mobility restrictions. There is at the same time unprecedented data coverage that allows nuanced analysis of the relationship between pandemic dynamics, changes in population mobility and the progress in vaccination campaigns and, of course, how the public perceives such measures. In this datathon, teams of 3-4 participants will be tasked to explore these relationships using a variety of highly spatially and temporally resolved datasets on each of these dynamics. The datasets, among others, will include mobility data during the pandemic and social media data. The goal is to use a data-driven lense to investigate these fundamental co-dependencies and reveal important variations within and between countries. Using the data provided, teams are free to focus on a particular aspect or question of their choice while leveraging any methodological approach. 

## Dates and format
The datathon will take place fully virtually from Thursday July 22, 2021 to Sunday July 25, 2021. Free individual registration until July 8, 2021 is open to all IC2S2 participants; teams will be centrally assigned by the organizers based on the participants’ experience, interests and skills. In the assignment process, we will strive to make the teams diverse and at the same time balanced.

## Datasets
We suggest working with several datasets.
Some of them deal with mobility during COVID-19 times around the globe.
These are Google's Covid mobility dataset https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/
And Apple's mobility dataset https://covid19.apple.com/mobility
To augment this data and check the situation regarding COVID-19 in specific countries, you can use data on COVID-19 cases, ICU occupancy, hospitalizations, etc. There are many data sources for that. One we suggest using is https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide or on vaccinations outside the EU/EEA area from here https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

## Possible topics to explore
Association between mobility patterns and case numbers. For instance: Is reduction in the visits to grocery stores associated with decreased covid cases within ~10-14 days?)
Association between public opinion and mobility changes.
Is there a mobility divide? E.g., do we see persistent differences in terms of mobility during covid between countries? What are potential explanations for this?
Vaccination and mobility (how fast does vaccination bring people to “business as usual”. Does increase in vaccination lead to increase in mobility even when all measures stay in place? (e.g., people start visiting their vaccinated elderly relatives more / get more relaxed in general, though the measures such as closing of restaurants stay in place).
